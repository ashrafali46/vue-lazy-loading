## Summary

Fast loading speed is essential when creating any web application. A few extra
seconds could have a huge impact on the number of users visiting your site. This
means that having a fast site is important, not just for ranking well in Google
Search Engine, but for having users interact with your webpage.

Vue 3 has introduced several new features to help you achieve this easily
through the improvements to the async component API and the new Suspense
component. In this video, we will be taking a look at using lazying loading
components in Vue 3 to speed up your pages load times.
